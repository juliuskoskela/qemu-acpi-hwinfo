# Flake Restructuring Summary

## What Was Done

Successfully restructured the monolithic `flake.nix` (407 lines) into a modular, maintainable structure using flake-parts and devshell.

## New Structure

```
nix/
├── packages.nix      # Package definitions (hwinfo generation)
├── devshell.nix      # Development shell with convenience commands  
├── formatter.nix     # Code formatting with treefmt-nix
├── nixos-modules.nix # NixOS modules for host and guest
├── lib.nix          # Library functions for VM creation
└── README.md        # Documentation for the nix infrastructure
```

## Key Improvements

### Size Reduction
- **Before**: 407 lines in monolithic flake.nix
- **After**: 40 lines in main flake.nix + modular components
- **Reduction**: 90% smaller main flake

### Code Quality
- ✅ Eliminated code duplication (generateHwInfo was defined twice)
- ✅ Added proper formatting with treefmt-nix
- ✅ Better error handling and type safety with flake-parts
- ✅ Consistent code style across all files

### Developer Experience
- ✅ Rich development shell with helpful MOTD
- ✅ **`acpi-hwinfo`** convenience command to read current machine hardware
- ✅ **`build-hwinfo`** command to build packages easily
- ✅ **`test-vm`** command for VM testing guidance
- ✅ Automatic dependency management

### Architecture Benefits
- ✅ **Separation of Concerns**: Each module has a specific purpose
- ✅ **Maintainability**: Easy to modify individual components
- ✅ **Reusability**: Modules can be imported independently
- ✅ **Scalability**: Simple to add new modules
- ✅ **Documentation**: Comprehensive docs for each component

## New Convenience Command: `acpi-hwinfo`

When you enter the devshell with `nix develop`, you get the `acpi-hwinfo` command that:

1. **Reads current machine hardware info**:
   - NVMe serial number
   - MAC address
   
2. **Shows generated hwinfo if available**:
   - Displays hwinfo.json content
   
3. **Provides helpful usage instructions**:
   - How to build packages
   - How to use custom values

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Enter development environment
nix develop

# Read hardware info from current machine
acpi-hwinfo

# Build hwinfo package
build-hwinfo

# Format all code
nix fmt

# Build with custom values
nix build .#packages.x86_64-linux.generateHwInfo
```

## Technical Implementation

### flake-parts Integration
- Uses flake-parts for better module composition
- Automatic system handling across platforms
- Type checking and better error messages

### devshell Integration  
- Rich development environment
- Custom commands with help text
- Environment variables and MOTD

### treefmt-nix Integration
- Consistent code formatting
- Multiple formatters (nixpkgs-fmt, shellcheck, shfmt)
- Integrated into development workflow

## Migration Benefits

1. **Maintainability**: Much easier to understand and modify
2. **Collaboration**: Clear separation makes team development easier  
3. **Testing**: Individual modules can be tested independently
4. **Documentation**: Each component is well-documented
5. **Extensibility**: Adding new features is straightforward

## Backward Compatibility

All existing functionality is preserved:
- ✅ Package building works the same
- ✅ NixOS modules are unchanged in functionality
- ✅ Library functions work identically
- ✅ All scripts and examples still work

The restructuring is purely organizational and adds new convenience features without breaking existing workflows.
